# NextJS-Guild-API
A challenge to learn NextJS, with "make anything!" as the only criteria. I recently was digging into the Blizzard API and decided that now would be a great time to learn both! This NextJS app will pull live guild and character information from World of Warcraft! For ease of use and the time-crunch, utilizing the 'battlenet-api-wrapper' package.
